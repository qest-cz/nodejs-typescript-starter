# Nodejs typescript starter
If you need typescript starter pack for node.js development. You are on 
right place. Repository contains only must have (for our point of view) 
dependencies to build. The repository solves 4 main parts

- **Run in development mode** - we use `ts-node` as a typescript execution environment,
`dot-env` library for setting up environment variables
- **Run tests** there is a predefined way how to run tests with `mocha`, in future we will replace with `jest` probably
- **Build application** - for build is used clasic way of `tsc`
- **Run in production mode** - run compiled code 


## List of used libraries
- `mocha`, `chai` for testing - it will be updated with jest in 0.1.0
- `nyc` for code coverage
- `prettier`, `tslint` for code style checking
- `nodemon` 
- `pino-pretty` for nice console output  

## Scripts

### Basic  scripts
- `yarn`
install dependencies
- `yarn build`
build application
- `yarn dev`
start development mode
- `yarn test`
run tests
- `yarn code:fix` 
apply prettier rules for project

 ### Useful for CI/CD
 - `yarn test:cover` 
 check code coverage in project - it can be set in package.json (nyc part)
 - `yarn code:check` 
 checking code style policies by prettier and tslint
 
 ### FAQ
 **Where can env variables can be set?**
 - For setting of env variables is used dotenv package https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv, there are .env files in `./config` folder
